# appak's github pages page
just a funky website. here are the pages:
- projects I like and want to "archive" (copy and steal for later)

created only bc I was bored of stealing other stuff :skull:

## TO DO

- some tools maybe
- more funny games I want to poke around in
- nice layout maybe
- learn some more css and web development
- more pages :)
- get eggs

## do you want to contribute a web-based project that would fit in? contact me on:
